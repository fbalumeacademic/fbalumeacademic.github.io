Welcome to my personal website!

I’m currently a PhD candidate in Corporate Finance, with a focus on the bankruptcy costs faced by leveraged buyout (LBO) companies in financial distress.

Here, you’ll find details about my research projects and my publications, as well as useful resources for anyone interested in exploring finance further. My goal is to provide insights into Corporate Finance and help address some of the key challenges in the field. Alongside my research, I also teach courses in Finance, Accounting, and Management Control.

In my blog, I share thoughts on topics of interest, as well as updates on my research journey, including experiences at international conferences and visiting research programs. I try to give an honest account of this path, capturing not only the milestones but also the reflections, occasional doubts, and learning moments along the way.

I hope you will find some new ideas and inspiration here. Please feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas.

Thanks for visiting, and enjoy exploring!
