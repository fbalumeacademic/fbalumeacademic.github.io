Welcome to my personal website!

I’m currently a PhD candidate working on my thesis in Corporate Finance, with a focus on the bankruptcy costs faced by leveraged buyout (lbo) companies in financial distress.

On this site, you’ll find information on my courses, research projects, and publications, along with resources for those interested in delving deeper into finance.

Through my work, I aim to contribute meaningful insights to the field of Corporate Finance and address some of the pressing challenges it faces today. Alongside my research, I also teach courses in Finance, Accounting, and Management control.

My blog is where I share my thoughts on topics that interest me, as well as updates from my research journey, including my experiences at international conferences and visiting research programs. I aim to give an honest account of the journey—capturing not only the milestones but also the reflections, occasional doubts, and learning moments along the way.

I hope you find some fresh ideas and inspiration here. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas.

Happy exploring, and thanks for stopping by!
