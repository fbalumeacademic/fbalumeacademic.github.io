### Definition and general considerations

In this press article, I would like to address the issue of hedge funds identified by finance and economics researchers as a specific category of funds known as “vulture funds” (VF). These are investment funds whose activity is comparable to that of vultures towards companies in difficulty, or even governments. These funds operate in the context of bankruptcy, as periods of financial difficulty are conducive to vulture funds purchasing discounted corporate debt, which they then use as leverage for a “loan-to-own” or “yield chasing” strategy. Research on this topic has focused almost exclusively on the impact of these funds on governments (except Hotchkiss and Moradian, 1997; Gietzmann, 2018). In my study published in the journal *Finance-Contrôle-Stratégie* (2024), I conduct an in-depth exploration of the impact of vulture funds' activity on the bankruptcy process of two companies previously acquired with leverage (LBO): Vivarte and Camaïeu. I have observed that these funds generally seek to maximize their returns by employing various aggressive strategies (both legal and illegal), and that the activities of these funds can exacerbate the company's financial difficulties, complicate managerial decision-making, and prevent efficient decision-making. This is due in particular to the residual cognitive costs generated by the activities of vulture funds during periods of financial difficulty.

### Key results and important points of analysis

#### Acquisition strategy

Vulture funds target companies that are in difficulty but have profit prospects. These funds pursue what is known as a loan-to-own strategy. The fact that their targets are companies with a high probability of bankruptcy due to high default rates enables these funds to negotiate debt at reduced prices. This gives them substantial control over the restructuring process, at the end of which they may obtain an equity stake in their target, and take control of these companies.

#### Impact on businesses and economies

The aggressive tactics employed by vulture funds can exacerbate corporate financial instability and, in the case of sovereign debt, destabilize national economies. By focusing on the VF impact on LBO companies, my paper notes that the VF action often results in increased costs (in particular cognitive costs) and reduced investment in long-term, value-generating activities... More generaly, vulture funds are not limited to companies in difficulty, but also extend to governments. The modus operandi remains the same, with a strategy aimed at buying debt and then demanding a higher return than expected.

#### Ethical and regulatory considerations

My study examines the ethical implications of vulture fund practices and calls for increased regulatory oversight. It argues that while vulture funds fill a niche by providing liquidity in distressed markets, their actions often come at a high societal cost. For example, I find that the two cases studied in the french clothing sector (Camaïeu and Vivarte), in which vulture funds were present, experienced ethical scandals such as being involved in the Rana plaza building collapse scandal or illegal surveillance scandals. This illustrates the deterioration in working conditions, confirmed by the numerous employee protests. My work highlights the need for a balance between debt market efficiency and ethical responsibility, suggesting that the unrestricted activities of vulture funds can lead to financial inefficiency and long-term economic damage. I propose that greater transparency and regulation can be put in place to mitigate these negative effects while allowing distressed debt markets to function effectively.

#### Legal considerations

The law can play an important role in limiting the reach of vulture funds and the impact of their actions on distressed companies. Indeed, there are some differences in legislation between countries. Belgium, for example, has succeeded in legislating in this area by significantly limiting the action of vulture funds, but the regulations in France are not entirely in line with the need to protect the survival of companies. And the law seems to be moving in two directions. On the one hand, the *Sapin II* law, which aims to make business life more ethical, may help to protect companies (provided that it includes a clear reference to financial partners). However, recent changes to bankruptcy law in France, which tend to be modeled on US bankruptcy law, are likely to favor debt holders, even if they bought the debt knowing that the company was financially distressed.

#### Beyond my study, the impact of vulture funds on governments

According to studies carried out on vulture funds at country level, these funds can seriously impact the economy of a high-risk country by buying up its sovereign debt at low prices. These funds then demand high repayments, usually through default and aggressive legal proceedings. These practices force governments to allocate a significant proportion of their resources to repaying this debt, to the detriment of essential public spending such as education, health and infrastructure.

This financial pressure slows economic recovery and exacerbates poverty, as resources that could be invested in development are diverted to satisfy the demands of these creditors. Financing costs also rise, as the risk of having debt bought by vulture funds in the event of default prompts investors to demand higher interest rates to compensate for this risk, further increasing the debt burden for fragile countries.

In terms of governance, the influence of vulture funds can lead to a loss of economic sovereignty for the countries affected. Budgetary decisions become constrained by the obligation to meet the demands of these creditors, limiting the ability of governments to pursue autonomous policies based on the needs of their populations. In addition, the legal procedures and agreements imposed by these funds, often in foreign jurisdictions, hamper a country's ability to manage its own debt in a sovereign and orderly manner. This influence not only disrupts political stability, but also weakens local institutions by imposing governance geared towards short-term financial goals rather than long-term development.

### Potential regulatory actions

#### Controlling vulture funds through legislation and concrete action

Just as Belgium has begun to do, countries would do well to strengthen their legislative arsenal to limit the action of vulture funds, which take advantage of companies in difficulty by buying up their debts in order to increase their profits under conditions that are detrimental to the economy. Governments can prevent the financial destabilization of strategic companies by introducing laws strictly regulating such takeovers. Furthermore, the creation of sovereign wealth funds able to buy up, in partnership with investors, the debt of national companies in difficulty would offer a solid and more stable alternative to speculative private capital. Such an initiative would protect local economies, reduce the hold of vulture funds, and ensure better management of resources to support long-term growth. In France, for example, the role of an organization like the BPI France could be extended to include investment in distressed companies.

#### Favoring multilateral institutions over vulture funds to better manage sustainable development

At state level, it would be far more advantageous for countries in financial difficulty to comply with the conditions of the major multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank (BIRD), in order to obtain financing. These institutions offer loans at preferential rates and also provide technical support to strengthen economic stability, governance and sustainable development. On the other hand, recourse to vulture funds exposes countries to increased financial pressure, as these private investors seek to maximize their profits by imposing strict and often costly repayment conditions. Turning to multilateral institutions not only eases the debt burden, but also preserves public resources for essential investments in infrastructure, education and health, thereby contributing in a more balanced and sustainable way to a country's economic development.
