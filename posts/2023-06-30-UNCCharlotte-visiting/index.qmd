I had the privilege of being invited by Professor Dolly King to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as a visiting scholar from March to June 2023. During this period, I immersed myself in finance research at the Belk College laboratory, which was crucial for data collection and the completion of my thesis. I also had the opportunity to attend several research seminars. Professor King's guidance throughout my stay was invaluable, allowing me to fully engage with a cutting-edge research environment.

At UNC-Charlotte, you truly feel like you're in a self-sufficient, independent city. I believe the university’s administrators are fully aware of this, and it seems to be an intentional design. The university even embraces the nickname “Niner Nation,” with a structure that feels like a true nation, complete with its own "president."

During my time at UNC-Charlotte, I took full advantage of the university's impressive research and sports facilities. The advanced laboratories, equipped with cutting-edge technology, enabled me to conduct research using high-quality tools. I especially appreciated access to valuable databases like WRDS, Bloomberg, and SDC Platinum.

At the end of this stay, I co-authored a paper with Professor Dolly King and Professor Jean-François Gajewski, which was accepted and presented at several national and international conferences. The research explores the relationship between strong financial constraints and a company's ESG commitment.

This experience was invaluable, both academically and personally, enriching my understanding of contemporary finance issues and immersing me in American culture. In Charlotte, I had the pleasure of meeting wonderful people, such as Professor Eddy Souffrant and his family, as well as the Atsushi couple, fellow visiting scholars from Japan whom I met through Professor Dolly King.

Beyond North Carolina, I also traveled to other states, including Texas, where I visited my cousin Tristan and his family—creating some truly great memories!
