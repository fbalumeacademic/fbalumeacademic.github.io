I had the opportunity to be invited by Professor Dolly King at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as a visiting scholar from march to june 2023. During this period, I had the chance to immerse myself in finance research in the Belk College laboratory, which was essential for collecting essential data and unlocking the finalization of my thesis. In particular, I took part in various research seminars. The Professor Dolly's guidance throughout my stay was invaluable and enabled me to immerse myself in a research environment leading the way.

At UNC-Charlotte, you feel like you're in a small, independent city. I think the University's administrators are well aware of this, and this organization is a voluntary one. The reason I say this is that the university bears the nickname Naner Nation (a true nation with a president at its head). During my time at UNC-Charlotte, I took full advantage of the nation's impressive research and sports facilities. I had access to advanced laboratories equipped with the best technology, which enabled me to carry out my research with top-quality tools. I'm thinking in particular of access to databases such as WRDS, Bloomberg and SDC Platinum.

At the end of this stay, I co-authored a paper with Professor Dolly King and Professor Jean-François Gajewski, which was accepted and presented at several conferences, both national and international. It's an interesting piece of research on the link between strong financial constraints and a company's ESG commitment.

This stay has been an invaluable experience, both academically and personally, enriching my understanding of contemporary issues in finance and introducing me to American culture. In Charlotte, I had some wonderful encounters, such as Professor Eddy Souffrant and his family, and the Atushi couple, who were also visiting scholars from Japan and whom I met through Professor Dolly King.

Outside North Carolina, I made a few trips to other states, including Texas to visit my cousin Tristan and his family. Great memories!
