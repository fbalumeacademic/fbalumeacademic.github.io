I had the opportunity to be invited by Professor Dolly King at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as a visiting scholar from March to June 2023. During this time, I had the opportunitu to immerse myself in finance research at the Belk College laboratory, which was essential for the collection of essential data and the completion of my thesis. In particular, I attended various research seminars. The Professor Dolly's guidance throughout my stay was invaluable and enabled me to immerse myself in a cutting-edge research environment.

At UNC-Charlotte, you feel like you're in a small, independent town. I think the administration of the univrsity are well aware of this, and this organization is a voluntary one. The reason I say this is because the university is nicknamed Niner Nation (a real nation with a president at its head, a police service and a independent public transportation). During my time at UNC-Charlotte, I took full advantage of the nation's impressive research and athletic facilities. I had access to advanced laboratories equipped with the best technology, which allowed me to conduct my research with top-quality tools. I'm thinking in particular of access to databases such as WRDS, Bloomberg and SDC Platinum.

At the end of this stay, I co-authored a paper with Professor Dolly King and Professor Jean-François Gajewski that was accepted and presented at several national and international conferences. It's an interesting piece of research on the link between strong financial constraints and a company's ESG commitment.

This stay was an invaluable experience, both academically and personally, enriching my understanding of contemporary issues in finance and introducing me to American culture. In Charlotte, I had some wonderful encounters, such as Professor Eddy Souffrant and his family, and the Atushi couple, who were also visiting scholars from Japan and whom I met through Professor Dolly King.

Outside of North Carolina, I made a few trips to other states, including Texas to visit my cousin Tristan and his family. Great memories!
