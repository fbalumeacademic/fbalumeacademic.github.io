As part of my Ph.D. program, I was lucky enough to spend a month at the [University of Aarhus](https://econ.au.dk/research/finance) in Denmark from mid-July to mid-August 2022. I went there to take part in a summer school on Behavioral Finance. It was a really great experience. I had the opportunity to present the preliminary results of my research, which were subsequently published in the Review of Accounting and Finance. It also allowed me to meet many other students who, like me, are passionate about behavioral finance. And of course, it was also a great opportunity to discover the Danish culture, which made the trip even more special (many thanks to Nathalie, Benedicte and Morten).

The University of Aarhus that welcomed me was truly one of the best in the world. It is known for having outstanding researchers among its current and former professors, some of whom have won several awards. in fact, two Nobel Prize winners are associated with the history of this university: [Professor Jens Christian Skou](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Christian_Skou), who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997, and [Professor Dale T. Mortensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_T._Mortensen), who won of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2010.

The Behavioral Finance course I took at the university enabled me to deepen my knowledge of behavioral corporate finance. The course, designed and taught by Professor Tom Aabo, was both interesting and stimulating. In particular, it focused on the analysis of executive personality, a valuable approach not only for business management, but also for informing business decisions when dealing with a CEO or the company he or she represents.

This visit was also an opportunity to present my research in behavioral finance. We had just finished collecting data for the article I co-authored with Professor Jean-François Gajewski and Associate Professor Marco Heimann that was published in The Review of Accounting and Finance. It was therefore an excellent opportunity to share our preliminary results and get some feedbacks. The paper was subsequently presented at several other national and international conferences (AFFI, FEBS, CFIW2023, 3rd IEAP). I have to admit that this research was very well received by the scientific community, as the publication process was quite fast.
