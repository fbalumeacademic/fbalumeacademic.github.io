As part of my Ph.D. program, I had the privilege of spending a month at the [University of Aarhus](https://econ.au.dk/research/finance) in Denmark, from mid-July to mid-August 2022, to participate in a summer school on Behavioral Finance. It was a truly enriching experience. I had the chance to present the preliminary findings of my research, which were later published in the *Review of Accounting and Finance*. This experience also allowed me to connect with fellow students who, like me, are passionate about behavioral finance. And, of course, it was a wonderful opportunity to immerse myself in Danish culture, which made the trip even more memorable (special thanks to Nathalie, Benedicte, and Morten).

The University of Aarhus, which hosted me, is truly one of the top universities in the world. It is renowned for having distinguished researchers among its faculty, some of whom have earned prestigious accolades. Notably, two Nobel Prize winners are affiliated with the university's history: [Professor Jens Christian Skou](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Christian_Skou), , awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997, and [Professor Dale T. Mortensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_T._Mortensen), who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2010.

The Behavioral Finance course I attended, taught by Professor Tom Aabo, allowed me to deepen my understanding of behavioral corporate finance. The course was both intellectually stimulating and insightful, particularly in its focus on executive personality analysis. This approach is highly valuable not only for corporate management but also for making informed business decisions when interacting with CEOs or understanding the companies they lead.

This visit also provided me the opportunity to present my research in behavioral finance. We had just completed the data collection for the paper I co-authored with Professor Jean-François Gajewski and Associate Professor Marco Heimann, which was subsequently published in *The Review of Accounting and Finance*. Sharing our preliminary results at Aarhus was an excellent opportunity to gather feedback. The paper was later presented at several national and international conferences (AFFI, FEBS, CFIW2023, and the 3rd IEAP). I’m happy to say that the research was well received by the scientific community, and the publication process progressed quickly.
