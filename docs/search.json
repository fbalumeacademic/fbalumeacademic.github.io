    "text": "As part of my Ph.D. program, I had the privilege of spending a month at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, from mid-July to mid-August 2022, to participate in a summer school on Behavioral Finance. It was a truly enriching experience. I had the chance to present the preliminary findings of my research, which were later published in the Review of Accounting and Finance. This experience also allowed me to connect with fellow students who, like me, are passionate about behavioral finance. And, of course, it was a wonderful opportunity to immerse myself in Danish culture, which made the trip even more memorable (special thanks to Nathalie, Benedicte, and Morten).\nThe University of Aarhus, which hosted me, is truly one of the top universities in the world. It is renowned for having distinguished researchers among its faculty, some of whom have earned prestigious accolades. Notably, two Nobel Prize winners are affiliated with the university’s history: Professor Jens Christian Skou, , awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997, and Professor Dale T. Mortensen, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2010.\nThe Behavioral Finance course I attended, taught by Professor Tom Aabo, allowed me to deepen my understanding of behavioral corporate finance. The course was both intellectually stimulating and insightful, particularly in its focus on executive personality analysis. This approach is highly valuable not only for corporate management but also for making informed business decisions when interacting with CEOs or understanding the companies they lead.\nThis visit also provided me the opportunity to present my research in behavioral finance. We had just completed the data collection for the paper I co-authored with Professor Jean-François Gajewski and Associate Professor Marco Heimann, which was subsequently published in The Review of Accounting and Finance. Sharing our preliminary results at Aarhus was an excellent opportunity to gather feedback. The paper was later presented at several national and international conferences (AFFI, FEBS, CFIW2023, and the 3rd IEAP). I’m happy to say that the research was well received by the scientific community, and the publication process progressed quickly.

    "text": "I had the privilege of being invited by Professor Dolly King to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as a visiting scholar from March to June 2023. During this period, I immersed myself in finance research at the Belk College laboratory, which was crucial for data collection and the completion of my thesis. I also had the opportunity to attend several research seminars. Professor King’s guidance throughout my stay was invaluable, allowing me to fully engage with a cutting-edge research environment.\nAt UNC-Charlotte, you truly feel like you’re in a self-sufficient, independent city. I believe the university’s administrators are fully aware of this, and it seems to be an intentional design. The university even embraces the nickname “Niner Nation,” with a structure that feels like a true nation, complete with its own “president.”\nDuring my time at UNC-Charlotte, I took full advantage of the university’s impressive research and sports facilities. The advanced laboratories, equipped with cutting-edge technology, enabled me to conduct research using high-quality tools. I especially appreciated access to valuable databases like WRDS, Bloomberg, and SDC Platinum.\nAt the end of this stay, I co-authored a paper with Professor Dolly King and Professor Jean-François Gajewski, which was accepted and presented at several national and international conferences. The research explores the relationship between strong financial constraints and a company’s ESG commitment.\nThis experience was invaluable, both academically and personally, enriching my understanding of contemporary finance issues and immersing me in American culture. In Charlotte, I had the pleasure of meeting wonderful people, such as Professor Eddy Souffrant and his family, as well as the Atsushi couple, fellow visiting scholars from Japan whom I met through Professor Dolly King.\nBeyond North Carolina, I also traveled to other states, including Texas, where I visited my cousin Tristan and his family—creating some truly great memories!\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{balume2023,\n  author = {Balume, Fidèle},\n  title = {PhD {Visiting} Scholar at {UNC} {Charlotte}},\n  date = {2023-07-14},\n  url = {https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBalume, Fidèle. 2023. “PhD Visiting Scholar at UNC\nCharlotte.” July 14, 2023. https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/."
