    "text": "As part of my Ph.D. program, I had the privilege of spending a month at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, from mid-July to mid-August 2022, to participate in a summer school on Behavioral Finance. It was a truly enriching experience. I had the chance to present the preliminary findings of my research, which were later published in the Review of Accounting and Finance. This experience also allowed me to connect with fellow students who, like me, are passionate about behavioral finance. And, of course, it was a wonderful opportunity to immerse myself in Danish culture, which made the trip even more memorable (special thanks to Nathalie, Benedicte, and Morten).\nThe University of Aarhus, which hosted me, is truly one of the top universities in the world. It is renowned for having distinguished researchers among its faculty, some of whom have earned prestigious accolades. Notably, two Nobel Prize winners are affiliated with the university’s history: Professor Jens Christian Skou, , awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997, and Professor Dale T. Mortensen, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2010.\nThe Behavioral Finance course I attended, taught by Professor Tom Aabo, allowed me to deepen my understanding of behavioral corporate finance. The course was both intellectually stimulating and insightful, particularly in its focus on executive personality analysis. This approach is highly valuable not only for corporate management but also for making informed business decisions when interacting with CEOs or understanding the companies they lead.\nThis visit also provided me the opportunity to present my research in behavioral finance. We had just completed the data collection for the paper I co-authored with Professor Jean-François Gajewski and Associate Professor Marco Heimann, which was subsequently published in The Review of Accounting and Finance. Sharing our preliminary results at Aarhus was an excellent opportunity to gather feedback. The paper was later presented at several national and international conferences (AFFI, FEBS, CFIW2023, and the 3rd IEAP). I’m happy to say that the research was well received by the scientific community, and the publication process progressed quickly.

    "text": "I had the privilege of being invited by Professor Dolly King to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as a visiting scholar from March to June 2023. During this period, I immersed myself in finance research at the Belk College laboratory, which was crucial for data collection and the completion of my thesis. I also had the opportunity to attend several research seminars. Professor King’s guidance throughout my stay was invaluable, allowing me to fully engage with a cutting-edge research environment.\nAt UNC-Charlotte, you truly feel like you’re in a self-sufficient, independent city. I believe the university’s administrators are fully aware of this, and it seems to be an intentional design. The university even embraces the nickname “Niner Nation,” with a structure that feels like a true nation, complete with its own “president.”\nDuring my time at UNC-Charlotte, I took full advantage of the university’s impressive research and sports facilities. The advanced laboratories, equipped with cutting-edge technology, enabled me to conduct research using high-quality tools. I especially appreciated access to valuable databases like WRDS, Bloomberg, and SDC Platinum.\nAt the end of this stay, I co-authored a paper with Professor Dolly King and Professor Jean-François Gajewski, which was accepted and presented at several national and international conferences. The research explores the relationship between strong financial constraints and a company’s ESG commitment.\nThis experience was invaluable, both academically and personally, enriching my understanding of contemporary finance issues and immersing me in American culture. In Charlotte, I had the pleasure of meeting wonderful people, such as Professor Eddy Souffrant and his family, as well as the Atsushi couple, fellow visiting scholars from Japan whom I met through Professor Dolly King.\nBeyond North Carolina, I also traveled to other states, including Texas, where I visited my cousin Tristan and his family—creating some truly great memories!\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{balume2023,\n  author = {Balume, Fidèle},\n  title = {PhD {Visiting} Scholar at {UNC} {Charlotte}},\n  date = {2023-07-14},\n  url = {https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBalume, Fidèle. 2023. “PhD Visiting Scholar at UNC\nCharlotte.” July 14, 2023. https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/."

    "title": "Vulture funds",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Definition and general considerations\nIn this post, I would like to discuss the funds identified by researchers in finance and economics as a specific category of hedge funds called vulture funds. There are indeed investors whose actions are comparable to those of vultures on companies, or even governments. Indeed, the very first research on this subject focused almost exclusively on the impact of these funds on governments. One of the very first studies to document the impact of vulture funds on companies is Gietzmann, 2018. In my 2024 study, I propose an in-depth exploration of the notion of vulture funds. In particular, I describe the role of vulture funds in the failure of LBO companies due to their actions throughout the period of financial distress. These troubled financial periods are perfect for vulture funds to buy this type of debt, which they use as a leverage tool for the debtor. They typically seek to maximize returns by employing a variety of aggressive strategies, such as legal action or revising pricing terms that are favorable only to them, but which may exacerbate the financial difficulties faced by the original borrower.\n\n\nKey results and important points of analysis\n\nAcquisition strategy\nVulture funds target companies that are in difficulty but have profit prospects. These funds pursue what is known as a loan-to-own strategy. The fact that their targets are companies with a high probability of bankruptcy due to high default rates enables these funds to negotiate debt at reduced prices. This gives them substantial control over the restructuring process, at the end of which they obtain an equity stake in their target.\n\n\nImpact on businesses and economies\nThe aggressive tactics employed by vulture funds can exacerbate corporate financial instability and, in the case of sovereign debt, destabilize national economies. My paper notes that this approach often results in increased costs and reduced investment in long-term, value-generating activities. But even more importantly, vulture funds are not limited to companies in difficulty, but also extend to governments. The modus operandi remains the same, with a strategy aimed at buying debt and then demanding a higher return than expected.\n\n\nEthical and regulatory considerations\nThis article examines the ethical implications of vulture fund practices and calls for increased regulatory oversight. It argues that while vulture funds fill a niche by providing liquidity in distressed markets, their actions often come at a high societal cost. For example, I find that the companies in which vulture funds operate experience ethical scandals such as being involved in the Rana plaza building collapse scandal or illegal surveillance scandals. My work highlights the need for a balance between debt market efficiency and ethical responsibility, suggesting that the unchecked activities of vulture funds can lead to financial inefficiency and long-term economic damage. I propose that greater transparency and regulation can be put in place to mitigate these negative effects while allowing distressed debt markets to function effectively.\n\n\nLegal considerations\nThe law can play an important role in limiting the reach of vulture funds and the impact of their actions on distressed companies. Indeed, there are some differences in legislation between countries. Belgium, for example, has succeeded in legislating in this area by significantly limiting the action of vulture funds, but the regulations in France are not entirely in line with the need to protect the lives of companies. And the law seems to be moving in two directions. On the one hand, the Sapin II law, which aims to make business life more ethical, may help to protect companies (provided that it includes a clear reference to financial partners). However, recent changes to bankruptcy law in France, which tend to be modeled on US bankruptcy law, are likely to favor debt holders, even if they bought the debt knowing that the company was in difficulty.\n\n\nBeyond my study, the impact of vulture funds on governments\nAccording to studies carried out on vulture funds at country level, these funds can seriously impact the economy of a high-risk country by buying up its sovereign debt at low prices. These funds then demand high repayments, usually through default and aggressive legal proceedings. These practices force governments to allocate a significant proportion of their resources to repaying this debt, to the detriment of essential public spending such as education, health and infrastructure.\nThis financial pressure slows economic recovery and exacerbates poverty, as resources that could be invested in development are diverted to satisfy the demands of these creditors. Financing costs also rise, as the risk of having debt bought by vulture funds in the event of default prompts investors to demand higher interest rates to compensate for this risk, further increasing the debt burden for fragile countries.\nIn terms of governance, the influence of vulture funds can lead to a loss of economic sovereignty for the countries affected. Budgetary decisions become constrained by the obligation to meet the demands of these creditors, limiting the ability of governments to pursue autonomous policies based on the needs of their populations. In addition, the legal procedures and agreements imposed by these funds, often in foreign jurisdictions, hamper a country’s ability to manage its own debt in a sovereign and orderly manner. This influence not only disrupts political stability, but also weakens local institutions by imposing governance geared towards short-term financial goals rather than long-term development.\n\n\n\nPotential actions\n\nControlling vulture funds through legislation and concrete action\nJust as Belgium has begun to do, countries would do well to strengthen their legislative arsenal to limit the action of vulture funds, which take advantage of companies in difficulty by buying up their debts in order to increase their profits under conditions that are detrimental to the economy. Governments can prevent the financial destabilization of strategic companies by introducing laws strictly regulating such takeovers. Furthermore, the creation of sovereign wealth funds able to buy up, in partnership with investors, the debt of national companies in difficulty would offer a solid and more stable alternative to speculative private capital. Such an initiative would protect local economies, reduce the hold of vulture funds, and ensure better management of resources to support long-term growth.\n\n\nFavoring multilateral institutions over vulture funds to better manage sustainable development\nAt state level, it would be far more advantageous for countries in financial difficulty to comply with the conditions of the major multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank (BIRD), in order to obtain financing. These institutions offer loans at preferential rates and also provide technical support to strengthen economic stability, governance and sustainable development. On the other hand, recourse to vulture funds exposes countries to increased financial pressure, as these private investors seek to maximize their profits by imposing strict and often costly repayment conditions. Turning to multilateral institutions not only eases the debt burden, but also preserves public resources for essential investments in infrastructure, education and health, thereby contributing in a more balanced and sustainable way to a country’s economic development.\nAccess my study in Finance-Contrôle-Stratégie academic journal here\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{balume2024,\n  author = {Balume, Fidèle},\n  title = {Vulture Funds},\n  date = {2024-11-07},\n  url = {https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2024-11-07-Vulture-funds/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBalume, Fidèle. 2024. “Vulture Funds.” November 7, 2024. https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2024-11-07-Vulture-funds/."

These funds pursue what is known as a loan-to-own strategy. The fact that their targets are companies with a high probability of bankruptcy due to high default rates enables these funds to negotiate debt at reduced prices. This gives them substantial control over the restructuring process, at the end of which they may obtain an equity stake in their target, and take control of these companies.\n\n\nImpact on businesses and economies\nThe aggressive tactics employed by vulture funds can exacerbate corporate financial instability and, in the case of sovereign debt, destabilize national economies. By focusing on the VF impact on LBO companies, my paper notes that the VF action often results in increased costs (in particular cognitive costs) and reduced investment in long-term, value-generating activities… More generaly, vulture funds are not limited to companies in difficulty, but also extend to governments. The modus operandi remains the same, with a strategy aimed at buying debt and then demanding a higher return than expected.\n\n\nEthical and regulatory considerations\nMy study examines the ethical implications of vulture fund practices and calls for increased regulatory oversight. It argues that while vulture funds fill a niche by providing liquidity in distressed markets, their actions often come at a high societal cost. For example, I find that the two cases studied in the french clothing sector (Camaïeu and Vivarte), in which vulture funds were present, experienced ethical scandals such as being involved in the Rana plaza building collapse scandal or illegal surveillance scandals. This illustrates the deterioration in working conditions, confirmed by the numerous employee protests. My work highlights the need for a balance between debt market efficiency and ethical responsibility, suggesting that the unrestricted activities of vulture funds can lead to financial inefficiency and long-term economic damage. I propose that greater transparency and regulation can be put in place to mitigate these negative effects while allowing distressed debt markets to function effectively.\n\n\nLegal considerations\nThe law can play an important role in limiting the reach of vulture funds and the impact of their actions on distressed companies. Indeed, there are some differences in legislation between countries. Belgium, for example, has succeeded in legislating in this area by significantly limiting the action of vulture funds, but the regulations in France are not entirely in line with the need to protect the survival of companies. And the law seems to be moving in two directions. On the one hand, the Sapin II law, which aims to make business life more ethical, may help to protect companies (provided that it includes a clear reference to financial partners). However, recent changes to bankruptcy law in France, which tend to be modeled on US bankruptcy law, are likely to favor debt holders, even if they bought the debt knowing that the company was financially distressed.\n\n\nBeyond my study, the impact of vulture funds on governments\nAccording to studies carried out on vulture funds at country level, these funds can seriously impact the economy of a high-risk country by buying up its sovereign debt at low prices. These funds then demand high repayments, usually through default and aggressive legal proceedings. These practices force governments to allocate a significant proportion of their resources to repaying this debt, to the detriment of essential public spending such as education, health and infrastructure.\nThis financial pressure slows economic recovery and exacerbates poverty, as resources that could be invested in development are diverted to satisfy the demands of these creditors. Financing costs also rise, as the risk of having debt bought by vulture funds in the event of default prompts investors to demand higher interest rates to compensate for this risk, further increasing the debt burden for fragile countries.\nIn terms of governance, the influence of vulture funds can lead to a loss of economic sovereignty for the countries affected. Budgetary decisions become constrained by the obligation to meet the demands of these creditors, limiting the ability of governments to pursue autonomous policies based on the needs of their populations. In addition, the legal procedures and agreements imposed by these funds, often in foreign jurisdictions, hamper a country’s ability to manage its own debt in a sovereign and orderly manner. This influence not only disrupts political stability, but also weakens local institutions by imposing governance geared towards short-term financial goals rather than long-term development.\n\n\n\nPotential regulatory actions\n\nControlling vulture funds through legislation and concrete action\nJust as Belgium has begun to do, countries would do well to strengthen their legislative arsenal to limit the action of vulture funds, which take advantage of companies in difficulty by buying up their debts in order to increase their profits under conditions that are detrimental to the economy. Governments can prevent the financial destabilization of strategic companies by introducing laws strictly regulating such takeovers. Furthermore, the creation of sovereign wealth funds able to buy up, in partnership with investors, the debt of national companies in difficulty would offer a solid and more stable alternative to speculative private capital. Such an initiative would protect local economies, reduce the hold of vulture funds, and ensure better management of resources to support long-term growth. In France, for example, the role of an organization like the BPI France could be extended to include investment in distressed companies.\n\n\nFavoring multilateral institutions over vulture funds to better manage sustainable development\nAt state level, it would be far more advantageous for countries in financial difficulty to comply with the conditions of the major multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank (BIRD), in order to obtain financing. These institutions offer loans at preferential rates and also provide technical support to strengthen economic stability, governance and sustainable development. On the other hand, recourse to vulture funds exposes countries to increased financial pressure, as these private investors seek to maximize their profits by imposing strict and often costly repayment conditions. Turning to multilateral institutions not only eases the debt burden, but also preserves public resources for essential investments in infrastructure, education and health, thereby contributing in a more balanced and sustainable way to a country’s economic development.\nAccess my study in Finance-Contrôle-Stratégie academic journal here\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{balume2024,\n  author = {Balume, Fidèle},\n  title = {Vulture Funds},\n  date = {2024-11-07},\n  url = {https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2024-11-07-Vulture-funds/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBalume, Fidèle. 2024. “Vulture Funds.” November 7, 2024. https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2024-11-07-Vulture-funds/."
