    "text": "As part of my PhD program, I was fortunate to spend a month at the University of Aarhus in Denmark from mid-July to mid-August 2022. I went there to take part in a summer school on behavioral finance. It was a really great experience. I had the opportunity to present the preliminary results of my research, which were subsequently published in the Review of Accounting and Finance. It also enabled me to meet many other students who, like me, are passionate about behavioral finance. And of course, it was also a great opportunity to discover the Danish culture, which made the trip even more special (many thanks to Nathalie, Benedicte and Morten).\nThe University of Aarhus, which welcomed me, was truly one of the best in the world. It is renowned for having outstanding researchers among its current and former professors, some of whom have won several awards. As a matter of fact, two Nobel Prize winners are associated with the history of this university: Professor Jens Christian Skou, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1997, and Professor Dale T. Mortensen, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2010.\nThe behavioral finance course I took at university enabled me to deepen my knowledge of behavioral corporate finance. The course, designed and taught by Professor Tom Aabo, was both interesting and stimulating. In particular, it focused on the analysis of executive personality, a valuable approach not only for business management, but also for informing business decisions when dealing with a CEO or the company he or she represents.\nThis visit was also an opportunity to present my research in behavioral finance. We had just finished collecting data for the article I co-authored with Professor Jean-François Gajewski and Associate Professor Marco Heimann, published in The Review of Accounting and Finance. It was therefore an excellent opportunity to share our preliminary results. The paper was subsequently presented at several other national and international conferences (AFFI, FEBS, CFIW2023, 3rd IEAP). I have to admit that this research was very well received by the scientific community, as the publication process went quite quickly.

    "text": "I had the opportunity to be invited by Professor Dolly King at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as a visiting scholar from march to june 2023. During this period, I had the chance to immerse myself in finance research in the Belk College laboratory, which was essential for collecting essential data and unlocking the finalization of my thesis. In particular, I took part in various research seminars. The Professor Dolly’s guidance throughout my stay was invaluable and enabled me to immerse myself in a research environment leading the way.\nAt UNC-Charlotte, you feel like you’re in a small, independent city. I think the University’s administrators are well aware of this, and this organization is a voluntary one. The reason I say this is that the university bears the nickname Naner Nation (a true nation with a president at its head). During my time at UNC-Charlotte, I took full advantage of the nation’s impressive research and sports facilities. I had access to advanced laboratories equipped with the best technology, which enabled me to carry out my research with top-quality tools. I’m thinking in particular of access to databases such as WRDS, Bloomberg and SDC Platinum.\nAt the end of this stay, I co-authored a paper with Professor Dolly King and Professor Jean-François Gajewski, which was accepted and presented at several conferences, both national and international. It’s an interesting piece of research on the link between strong financial constraints and a company’s ESG commitment.\nThis stay has been an invaluable experience, both academically and personally, enriching my understanding of contemporary issues in finance and introducing me to American culture. In Charlotte, I had some wonderful encounters, such as Professor Eddy Souffrant and his family, and the Atushi couple, who were also visiting scholars from Japan and whom I met through Professor Dolly King.\nOutside North Carolina, I made a few trips to other states, including Texas to visit my cousin Tristan and his family. Great memories!\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{balume2023,\n  author = {Balume, Fidèle},\n  title = {PhD {Visiting} Scholar at {UNC} {Charlotte}},\n  date = {2023-07-14},\n  url = {https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBalume, Fidèle. 2023. “PhD Visiting Scholar at UNC\nCharlotte.” July 14, 2023. https://fbalumeacademic.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/."
